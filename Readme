Pull out sections between timestamps in mysql log files.  btsch uses a binary search to find the timestamps in the log file and then dumps the relevant logs [start, stop)

If no output filename is given it'll dump to stdout.  If you are running the debug version, the debug output is all sent to stderr.


usage: ./btsch start_time stop_time input_filename [output_filename]
        start and stop times are in the format of 'YYMMDD hh:mm:ss'
        use 0 for start time to start at the beginning of file
        this tool uses strptime which will blow up in 2068

Example:

./btsch '160409 7:04:19' '160409 7:04:20' mysql.log | less



If you have a compiler you should be able to just do make or make debug to create the program.
